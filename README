Sync-App

An App which syncs Mobile and Desktop through internet and enables access to functionalities of both. This requires cloud storage space like Dropbox.



To use the App:
1. You need to have an online account at Dropbox (Register at www.dropbox.com)


There are two parts of the App:
1) Mobile Part (Android)
2) Desktop Part (Python)

For Desktop Part:

1. Run the setup.py file from the dropbox_api_setup folder. This can be used as your current working folder.
2. Perform OAuth to link to your dropbox account online and get an access token
    - run the doOauth.py file and follow the steps as mentioned
      (A new token_store file will be created in the folder. This is your access token.)
3. Copy all the files from protocol_and_command_classes folder in your working folder (i.e. dropbox_api_setup folder)
    (These are the files which perform the listening, parsing, crafting and other protocol functions along with the 
     classes for protocol commands)
4. To start listening to the device_file on Dropbox run: python listend.py
5. There are three Apps which are currently being developed:
