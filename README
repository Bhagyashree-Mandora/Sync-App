An App which syncs Mobile and Desktop through internet and enables access to functionalities of both. This requires cloud storage space like Dropbox.



To use the App:

There are two parts of the App:
1) Mobile Part (Android)
2) Desktop Part (Python)

For installing the app you can install the .apk file @ Android apk/Unify.apk,

      (A new token_store file will be created in the folder. This is your access token.)
3. Copy all the files from protocol_and_command_classes folder in your working folder (i.e. dropbox_api_setup folder)
    (These are the files which perform the listening, parsing, crafting and other protocol functions along with the 
     classes for protocol commands)
